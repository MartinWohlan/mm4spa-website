<h1>Development and Visualization of sport-relevant game and tactical analyses</h1>

The digitalization increasingly influences many top-class sports. Technological advances enable precise collection of positional data, which is, however, only of minor benefit in practice. The goal of this cooperation project is the development and visualization of sport-relevant game and tactical analyses. This is to be achieved through the intelligent multimodal fusion of video, position and event data. In combination with suitable expert models, this enables the provision of digital assistants for sports analysis.
